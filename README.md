#HTML
Using HTML and CSS, create a personal website for yourself. The purpose of this site will be to act as a home page and portal and should show off both your HTML and CSS skills along with telling a little bit about you. This could eventually be one of your portfolio pieces when applying for jobs after graduation.
The site should have at least 3 pages. Each page should have navigation to get between each page
You should use at least one CSS file that gets included in the head of every page. Feel free to use as many CSS files as you deem necessary.
There should be an HTML form on one of the pages of your site. It can be a contact form, an order form (for a fictitious product?) — be creative. Be sure to use at least 5 form INPUTS (input, textarea, select, etc). The form MUST validate (not all fields are required to validate).
The form has to submit the data using method GET and passthrough values on the URL upon submitting.
This should be done by you and you alone — and not copied off of the internet — I will find out.
Remember YOU CANNOT USE BOOTSTRAP (OR ANY FRONTEND FRAMEWORK FOR THIS PROJECT valid HTML and CSS is very important!
